Hi! My name is Lavender Jiang (蒋遥). I am a third year undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, with majors in ECE and math. I am a research assistant for Professor [José Moura](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/), and I work on graph sampling and [graph signal processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00468.pdf).
