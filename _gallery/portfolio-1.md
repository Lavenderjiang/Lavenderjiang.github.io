I participated in VEX robotics competition and DJI [RoboMaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrhvZhPaxQ4) in high school.  

At CMU, I am part of the [RoboClub](https://roboticsclub.org/), and I built [autonomous drone](https://build18.herokuapp.com/garage/project/243/) and [dancing roomba](https://build18.herokuapp.com/garage/project/393/) in Build18.  

I really like drones (and flying things in general), and I wish I crash less often :wink:
